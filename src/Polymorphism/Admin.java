    Types of polymorphism
    -> Compile time or static polymorphism
       Achieved by method overloading
       same name but type argument return type can be different

    -> Run time or Dynamic polymorphism
       Achieved by method overriding

       let assume you have 2 class parent and the child both have the same name function
       then if you are calling through child it will prioritize the child function first
