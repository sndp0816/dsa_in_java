        A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according
        to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the
        new order of elements in the respective data structure.

        Working of quick sort
        choose any element ==> after first pass
        all the element less then < pivot will be on LHS(left hand side) of pivot
        element that are greater then > pivot will be at RHS(right hand side) of pivot

        Best Case: Ω (N log (N))
        Average Case: θ ( N log (N))
        Worst Case: O(N2)
        Auxiliary Space: O(1)
